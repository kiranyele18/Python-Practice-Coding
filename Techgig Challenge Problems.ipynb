    "# Virus Outbreak\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Martian land faraway, a new virus has evolved and is attacking the individuals at a fast pace. The scientists have figured out the virus composition, V. The big task is to identify the people who are infected. The sample of N people is taken to check if they are POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. A report is generated which provides the current blood composition B of the person.\n",

    "### POSITIVE or NEGATIVE ?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the blood composition of the person is a subsequence of the virus composition V, then the person is identified as POSITIVE otherwise NEGATIVE.\n",

    "Virus Composition, V = coronavirus\n",

    "Blood Composition of the person , B = ravus\n",
